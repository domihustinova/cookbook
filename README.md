## 🧠 Motivation

Over the years, I’ve collected a large number of recipes and saved them in various places—some as bookmarks, others as screenshots on my phone, and a few handwritten on paper. Eventually, it became difficult and time-consuming to quickly find a specific recipe. That's one of the main reasons I decided to create this app: to have a practical and efficient way to store all my favorite recipes in one place and add functionality that makes cooking easier, like the ability to cross off ingredients as I use them.

Additionally, building this app helps me improve my web development and design skills.

## 🚧 Work in Progress

This app is still a work in progress. I'm continuously adding new features and improving the user experience. I'm starting small by focusing on basic functionality such as crossing off used ingredients, adding a search field, and using locally stored recipes. In the future, I plan to introduce features like filtering recipes by tags, connecting the database, adding user authentication, and enabling recipe submission through the UI. Stay tuned! 👀
