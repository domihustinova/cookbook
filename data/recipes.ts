    instructions: [
      "Preheat the oven to 200 °C, grease a round form with butter and dust with coarse flour or breadcrumbs.",
      "Beat the eggs well with the sugar (you can beat by hand with a kitchen whisk), add the oil or butter and finally the kefir. Whisk thoroughly to combine all the ingredients well. To ensure the best result, take all the cold ingredients out of the fridge 30 minutes beforehand.",
      "In another bowl, mix both flours, cocoa, baking soda, and a pinch of salt. You can sift the dry ingredients to make them more airy. If you are too lazy to sift, at least mix them well with a dry whisk. This will help eliminate lumps and aerate the flour.",
      "Now whisk the 'dry' ingredients into the 'wet' ones in parts. Mix just until they combine into a smooth batter. Since you are working with baking soda, don't waste time and don't overmix the batter to preserve the bubbles.",
      "Pour the batter into the prepared cake form, place it in the preheated oven, and reduce the baking temperature to 180 °C. Bake for approximately 30-35 minutes, and towards the end of baking, check with a wooden skewer or toothpick. If it comes out clean and without crumbs, the cake is done.",
